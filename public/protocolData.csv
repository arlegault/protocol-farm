We believe a composable, gas-optimized, easy-to-use splitter contract is an important primitive that will help usher in a new wave of onchain collaboration & giving back. Here are a few ways 0xSplits is being used today:

Onchain Collaboration: Income from minting NFTs & royalties from secondary sales can be pointed to a Split's address. From then on, each Recipient will receive their portion of future income without the need for any manual disbursements or ongoing maintenance.
Giving Back: Rather than listing a single donation address for an open source project and trusting one of the contributors to disperse the proceeds, you may simple create a Split and have all donations be automatically distributed amongst the contributors. The developers may also grant a multisig the ability to modify the Split, allowing them change the Split's composition in the future as contributors change.

Jet Protocol,,,,,"Will Barnes, James Moreau",a decentralized protocol for borrowing and lending on the Solana Blockchain,"Jet Protocol will launch as an open source, non-custodial, borrowing and lending protocol
on the Solana Blockchain (“the Protocol” and “Jet Protocol”). The Protocol will allow users
to deposit supported tokens to the Protocol. They will receive interest back to incentivize
participation. Those deposits will sit in a pool that is also used for users looking to take out
a loan in supported tokens. Because of this, individual users are not matched, and the
Protocol can create rules to govern ratios, supported tokens, and a variety of other needs.",https://www.jetprotocol.io/,https://docs.jetprotocol.io/jet-protocol/whitepaper,@JetProtocol,https://discord.com/invite/RW2hsqwfej,,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/jet-protocol/
